# Update Skills

Pull the latest skills from the repository and report what changed.

## Execution

1. Run the update script:
   ```bash
   bash ~/.claude-skills/{{ORG_SLUG}}/scripts/update.sh
   ```

2. Report the output to the user. If the script indicates new plugins were added, make sure to highlight the `install.sh` command they need to run in a separate terminal.
