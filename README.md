## Adding a New Skill

The easiest way:

```
/build-skill
```

This walks you through requirements gathering, manual validation, scaffolding, and testing.

Or manually:

1. Pick the target plugin under `plugins/`
2. Copy a template: `cp -r templates/basic-skill/ plugins/<plugin>/skills/my-skill/`
3. Rename: `mv plugins/<plugin>/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md.template plugins/<plugin>/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`
4. Edit the SKILL.md with your content
5. Validate: `bash scripts/validate-skill.sh plugins/<plugin>/skills/my-skill`
6. Bump version in the plugin's `plugin.json` and root `marketplace.json`
7. Open a PR

Two templates are available:
- **basic-skill** — Knowledge/guidance-only skills with no scripts or references
- **advanced-skill** — Skills with helper scripts and reference documents

## Adding a New Plugin

To create a new skill group (e.g., `plugins/security-skills/`):

1. Create the directory structure under `plugins/`
2. Add a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest
3. Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
4. Add the plugin's `plugin.json` path to the `FILES_TO_REPLACE` array in `scripts/init.sh`
5. Add skills under the new plugin's `skills/` directory

See `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/SKILL-AUTHORING.md` for detailed instructions.
